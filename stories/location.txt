Workshop location
-------------------

The workshop will take place on the Pearson Building, `Department of Geography <http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk>`_, University College London, Gower Street. UCL is very close to Euston and King's Cross train stations, as well as being easily accessible using public transport (see `here <http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/about-the-department/contacts-location/how-to-find-the-department>`_ for more details).


Accommodation
--------------

Accommodation will be provided in `Passfield Hall <http://www.lsevacations.co.uk/Accommodation/Passfield-Hall/Passfield-Hall.aspx>`_ on the nights of the 30th and 31st March but attendees will be required to fund their own travel. The Hall is within walking distance of the main UCL campus. Meals will be provided on the days of the workshop only (including an evening meal on the 31st).

A map of both locations is shown below.
