Sessions
----------

Assimilating Data into JULES using a Particle Filter.
=======================================================

Tristan Quaife/Reading
***********************

This practical session will use a Resampling Particle Filter scheme to constrain the state vector of
the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (`JULES <http://jules.jchmr.org/>`_) with observations of land-atmosphere gas fluxes. The various Particle Filters are an attractive mechanism for Data Assimilation in land surface problems as they are fully non-linear and make no inherent assumptions about the statistics
of the model errors. Generally speaking however they require a larger number of ensemble
members than related techniques and often suffer from filter degeneracy. As well as exploring these
issues the practical implementation of the filter will be discussed and students will be able to take a
copy of the Python scripts used for the class. Additional reading materials and references will be
provided.

Practical variational data assimilation with ``eoldas_ng``
===========================================================

Jose GÃ³mez-Dans/UCL
*********************

Variational DA approaches are popular due to their simplicity and efficiency. While they suffer from
a number of shortcomings, they are often the only practical way of carrying out DA in real contexts.
In this session, we will explore the theory behind variational DA approaches to highlight their
limitations. We will use very simple vegetation models, complex observation operators based on
radiative transfer theory and sophisticated numerical approaches to explore the retrieval of
meaningful biophysical parameters (leaf area index, leaf chlorophyll concentration, etc.) from satellite data (e.g. surface directional reflectance). The emphasis is on a practical scheme to allow the students to apply the techniques to their own problems. The examples will be illustrated using the Python
language ``eoldas_ng`` package, freely available on-line.


Derivative code generation and quantitative network design
============================================================

Thomas Kaminski/FastOpt
*************************

Variational assimilation is based on code for evaluation of derivatives of the underlying model and
the observational operators. The first part of the lecture will present the basic principles of
automatic differentiation, a technique to provide such derivative code. The second part of the
lecture addresses the design of an observational network of the terrestrial carbon cycling. The
quantitative network design approach evaluates candidate networks in terms of constraining net and
gross carbon fluxes through assimilation into a terrestrial biosphere model.
The practical component will include: 

* Tangent and adjoint coding in Fortran; 
* Sensitivity Analysis using a simple Fortran model
* Playing with an online tool for quantitative network design

Assimilating different data streams into the ORCHIDEE land surface model
==========================================================================

Natasha MacBean/LSCE
*********************

Estimating parameters in land surface models is a non-trivial task; in the ORCHIDEE LSM alone
there are 300+ parameters. Investigating which are the most sensitive parameters, which data
streams can be used to constrain these parameters, and understanding the potential issues associated
with the data assimilation procedure, is an active research topic. In this practical we will explore the
impact of assimilating different, and combined, data streams into the ORCHIDEE model, including
surface net carbon, water and energy fluxes, atmospheric CO2 concentration data, biomass data and
satellite-derived observations of the vegetation seasonal cycle. The aim is to better understand the
possibilities and current limitations/future research directions associated with trying to constrain a
complex, physically based model.
